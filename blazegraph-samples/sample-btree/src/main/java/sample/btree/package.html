</head>
<body>

<p>

This package contains some sample code for using the B+Tree package.

<dl>

<dt>TempStoreExample</dt><dd>Shows how to create a temporary store, register
a B+Tree on the temporary store, and do basic CRUD operations on the B+Tree.</dd>

<dt>JournalExample</dt><dd>Shows how to create a Journal, how to register a
B+Tree on the journal, how to do basic CRUD operations on the B+Tree.  This
example also covers committing or aborting the write set on the journal and
re-opening an existing journal.</dd>

<dt>JournalTxExample</dt><dd>Shows how to create a Journal, how to register a
B+Tree on the journal, how to obtain a view of that B+Tree which is isolated
by a transaction, how to do basic CRUD operations on the B+Tree, and how to
commit the transaction.</dd>

<dt>ReadWriteIndexExample</dt><dd>Shows how to impose concurrency control on
a B+Tree using a wrapper class.  The B+Tree is thread-safe for readers, but
not for writers.  This example show how you can wrap the B+Tree with a skin
backed by a ReadWriteLock.</dd>

<dt>ReadWriteIndexTxExample</dt><dd>Shows how to use concurrent transactions
for the same B+Tree and how to detect a write-write conflict when a transaction
can not commit because a concurrent transaction has already modified the same
tuple and committed first.</dd>
